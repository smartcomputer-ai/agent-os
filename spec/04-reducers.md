# Reducers (Merged)

Reducer guidance is now merged into [spec/05-workflows.md](05-workflows.md).

Use `defmodule` with `module_kind: "workflow"` (legacy alias `"reducer"` is still accepted by loaders) and follow the workflow runtime model documented in `05-workflows.md`.

Quick links:
- Workflow model and patterns: [spec/05-workflows.md](05-workflows.md)
- AIR module/effect/policy schema details: [spec/03-air.md](03-air.md)
- Runtime architecture and routing: [spec/02-architecture.md](02-architecture.md)
