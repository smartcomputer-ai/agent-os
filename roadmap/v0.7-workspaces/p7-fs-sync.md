client and cli utils to keep a workspace in sync with the unix file system, but more focused on the reducer code that lives in world directories (and potentially other code/artifacts).

scope:
- import/export pipeline for workspace trees (world_io)
- ~-hex path encoding/decoding for interop
- CLI helpers for syncing a local directory to a workspace root
