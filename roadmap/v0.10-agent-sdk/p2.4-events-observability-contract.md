# P2.4: Event and Observability Contract

**Stage**: P2.4  
**Status**: Proposed  
**Depends on**: P2.1, P2.2, P2.3

## Purpose

Make agent events a stable API for UIs and headless automation, not ad hoc debug output.

This stage resolves concern #5.

## Scope

1. Define canonical SDK event schema:
   - `aos.agent/AgentEvent@1`
2. Required event fields:
   - `session_id`, `run_id`, `turn_id`, `step_id`,
   - `event_seq`,
   - `correlation_id`,
   - `causation` (event hash or intent hash).
3. Canonical event families:
   - lifecycle,
   - llm step,
   - tool call,
   - host control,
   - diagnostics.
4. Ordering/correlation guarantees:
   - durable order = journal order,
   - telemetry order = best effort with cursor metadata.
5. Payload channel policy:
   - bounded model channel,
   - full-fidelity operator channel.

## Non-Goals

- New kernel primitives for streaming.
- Product-level UI decisions.

## Deliverables

1. `AgentEvent` schema family and versioning policy.
2. Event emission helpers in `aos-agent-sdk`.
3. Contract notes for HTTP/SSE surfaces (cursor, resume, duplicate handling).
4. Trace/correlation rules aligned with existing `trace-get` workflow.

## Implementation Notes

- Align with `roadmap/v0.10-agent-sdk/p9-stream.md` but keep deterministic boundaries explicit: journal-derived events are authoritative.
- Ensure every externally visible transition maps to a canonical event kind.

## Exit Criteria

1. A headless consumer can reconstruct run progression from the event stream plus journal cursor.
2. No required correlation field is missing in integration tests.
3. Resume-from-cursor works without duplication of durable events.
4. Event schema evolution policy documented (additive changes, version bump rules).
5. Event contract validated in at least one UI integration path and one headless harness.
