- remove "namespace" params in blob put effects. They are not used.
- http params (explicit instead of single string)
- consider allowing inline variant arms in event schemas (relax "variant of refs" validation), or keep current rule for named payload identity
- make caps or enforcers optional
- how is idempotency_key used? injected and then used/available by reducers and pure modules?
